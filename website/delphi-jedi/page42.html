<span class="lesen"><b>Submitting code</b>
<p>
The JEDI Code Library is built upon donations made by the community. In the 
past several people have already donated their code snippets allowing us to build
the library that you see before you today. This, however, is not the end of the JCL.
As long as new donations arrive we will continue to develop and expand the JCL. 
Therefore the continuation of the JCL really lies in your hands. If you have some
code snippets that you think would be suitable for inclusion in the JCL then we
would love to receive them.
</p>
<b>The rules</b>
<p>There are a few rules that need to be observed. These primarily exist to 
protect ourselves and to make the inclusion of your code as efficient and smooth as possible.</p>

<p>All code that is submitted will be released under the terms of the 
<a href="page51.html">Mozilla Public License</a> and the terms of the
<a href="page52.html">GNU Lesser General Public License</a> after being 
processed by the JCL team. By submitting code to Project JEDI you implicitly 
agree to - and are assumed to understand the implications of this. We suggest 
you at least glance through these licenses before submitting your code. If you 
still have questions you can always <a href="page20.html">contact us</a> or post 
a question to the JEDI-JCL mailing list.</p>

<p>Submissions must be your own. If code is not your own, you are responsible 
for making sure that the code is not subject to any copyright or license that 
would prevent the JCL team to modify the code and release the resulting code
under the terms of the MPL license.</p>

<p>Code must be packaged in a standard zip compatible file.
You should use the highest compression available. Inside the package 
you must include an ascii text-only readme.txt file which clearly states 
your name, your e-mail address, optionally your homepage address and whether
you want to remain anonymous or not. Please also state that you agree that 
your files are published under the MPL and the LGPL licenses. You can use
the following template

<p>
<TABLE WIDTH=575 BGCOLOR=#FFFFD2 class="lesen">
<td>
Name: My name <br>
email: My email <br>
homepage: My homepage <br>
anonymous: NO <br>
<br> <br>
I hereby grant Project JEDI permission to include my donations as part of the JCL under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). If any further relicensing may take effect I want to be asked for permission again.
</td>
</table>
</p>

</p>
<p>
It may be that future developments make it necessary to add other licenses (e. g. a tripple license approach). Therefore we would ask you to give us permission to release your code under any license certified by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org). Such developments may be, for instance, porting to other operating systems, changes to the GPL/LGPL by the Free Software Fundation etc. In any case our commitment to the MPL/LGPL dual license approach stays alive. If you don't want to be disturbed by such developments we would like to ask you to use the following statement or something similar.
<p>
<TABLE WIDTH=575 BGCOLOR=#FFFFD2 class="lesen">
<td>
Name: My name <br>
email: My email <br>
homepage: My homepage <br>
anonymous: NO <br>
<br> <br>
I hereby grant Project JEDI permission to include my donations as part of the JCL under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). If any further relicensing may take effect I want to be asked for permission again unless the license which is added to the license scheme is certified by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org).

</p>
<p>Submitted code is subject to being reformatted to match the style conventions used throughout the JCL. In addition the code may be modified. Generically speaking you will not be contacted for permission to carry out modifications. No matter how much your code is modified, at all times the documentation will reflect you as being the author of the code. If you have objections to this you can include a note about it in the readme.txt. In that case we will not modify your code or contact you for permission. This only applies to significant modifications.</p>

<p>
The JCL is not a visual component library. To avoid confusion, a class is considered a component when it derives from TComponent and it's usage requires it to be installed in the IDE and be 'dropped on a form'. These kind of a classes will not be included in the JCL.

<p>If you have a component that you like to share with the world through Project JEDI then please go to Project JEDI VCL for the details on how to do that. A class that does not need to be installed in the IDE, eventhough it may exhibit some kind of visual interface at runtime, is not considered a component and is perfectly acceptable for the JCL.
</p>

<p>
With that said, you can <a href="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org?subject=JEDI Code Library Donation&body=Please make sure that your zip contains the following: - The donation itself - The readme.txt">send your donations</a>, by e-mail, to the JCL team. Please use "JEDI Code Library Donation" as the subject line and attach the zip-file as described in the previous section to the e-mail.
</p>

<p>Note that due to the volume of code that has been donated already we may not be able to include your code immediately into the next release. Depending on the volume of new donations we also may not get back to you in a timely manner, or at all. Usually we will reply with a "thank you" but in case you don't receive such a message you should check the Contributors page of the next JCL release. If your name does not appear there something may have gone wrong and you should <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
