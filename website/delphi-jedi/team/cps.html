<h1>Jedi Code Library - Cross Platform Strategy</h1>

<p>
This paper presents the JCL teams strategy for cross platform compliance of the
Jedi Code Library. It is based up on the discussions within the JCL newsgroup
and JCL developer mailing lists. This document is currently <b>work in progress</b>
and subject to changes with or without notice.
</p>

<p>
Version history: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.1  Initial release
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The main objective is to make the Jedi Code Library VisualCLX (Kylix for Delphi/Delphi) 
and Delphi.NET compatible. For a detailed explanation of the currently used 
terminology, see the following article <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,29460,00.html">
Overview of the VCL for .NET</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We have to cope with nearly all aspects of cross platform progamming, like 
different APIs, different operating system concepts etc. Since we want to be as 
crossplatform compatible as possible interface compatability is the most important
issue for us. Jedi Code Library users should have to opportunity the use the JCL
on whatever platform they like. Figure 1 shows the three basic layers we have to 
deal with:

<ul>
<li>Platform independant layer: Units which are not (or only very minor)
platform specific and do not depend on a specific component set. This doesn't mean 
that units in this layer have to consist of no platform dependant code, but they have to
be nearly 100% interface compatible and all functionality must have been ported to all
supported platforms. </li> 
<li>Platform dependant layer: Units which depend on a specific platform (e.g. JclCLI) </li>
<li>Component set dependant layer: Units which depend on a specific component set</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
The Jedi Code Library currently targets the following platforms:

<ul>
<li>Kylix for Delphi (Kylix 3) / Linux</li>
<li>Delphi (Version 5,6,7) / Microsoft Windows</li>
</p>
</ul>

and is trying to support the following platforms as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li>Delphi .NET / .NET (Micrsoft Windows) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As a mid or long term perspective we are hoping to get the JCL FreePascal compatible.
This involves the possibilty to have the JCL running on DOS, OS/2, FreeBSD and
AmigaOS. 
</p>

<h3>Common platform independant layer</h3>
<p>
This layer consists of all files which are not platform dependant or need only 
very minor adjustations. Furthermore all units in this layer do not depend on a
specific component set. Examples for common platform independant units are 
JclBase, JclDateTime, JclFileUtils and JclMath. The units have been ported to 
all platforms and are the crossplatform "core" of the Jedi Code Library. As a 
general rule a unit in this layer should have no platform specific ifdefs in its
interface section.
</p>

<h3>Platform dependant layer</h3>
<p>
Furthermore we do not have to differentiate between VCL and VisualCLX units only 
(the so called component set dependent layer), but also between UNIX, 
Windows and .NET dependent units. The platform dependent units doesn't need to be 
interface compatible (if there is an equivalent in one of the other suported platforms at all!).
An example for a platform dependant unit is JclCLI. Nonetheless if there are equivalents 
in all other supported platforms as well it might be considerable to write a more general 
class and include that unit into the common platform indepedant layer.
</p>

<h3>Component set dependant layer</h3>
<p>
When it comes to sharing code between VCL and VisualCLX-applications, some facts 
need to be stated:
</p>

<p>
<li>A unit is called <i>VCL-dependent</i>, when it uses some VCL-unit(s), e.g. Graphics.
</li>
<li>A unit is called <i>VisualCLX-dependent</i>, when it uses some VisualCLX-unit(s), 
e.g. QGraphics.</li>
</p>
<p>
When a unit contains neither VCL- nor VisualCLX-specific code, there is no 
problem: It can be used by either type of application.
</p>

<p>
While it is basically possible to create VCL-dependent and VisualCLX-dependent
variants of the same unit by means of conditional compilation - and use them in
VCL- and VisualCLX-applications respectively -, this method fails at design time:
One and the same unit cannot be installed twice in the IDE, not even as part of
different packages.  We would have to rename one of the variants, effectively
creating a new unit. Therefor we will use a preprocessor to resolve the 
conditional compilation symbols related to VCL/VisualCLX-specific code and create
VCL/VisualCLX units from a common codebase.
</p>
<p>
Component dependant units should be largely "interface compatible" - interface
adjustments for specific component sets are unavoidable - nonetheless similar
interfaces are desirable.
</p>


<h3>Preprocessor</h3>

<p>
The preprocessor jpp is a modified version of Barry Kelly's ppp tool.
In contrast to ppp, which resolves all conditional compilation directives 
without exception, with jpp symbols not only can be defined but also undefined. 
Those symbols which are neither defined nor explicitely undefined are considered
as of unknown status and it and its related source code remains untouched.
</p>

<p>
The usage of jpp is not too hard. It is called via

<pre>
jpp [options] &lt;input files&gt;...
</pre>

Possible options are

<pre>
  -i       Process includes
  -c       Process conditional directives
  -C       Strip comments
  -pxxx    Add xxx to include path
  -dxxx    Define xxx as a preprocessor conditional symbol
  -uxxx    Assume preprocessor conditional symbol xxx as not defined
  -x[n:]yyy  Strip first n characters from file name; precede filename by prefix yyy
</pre>
 
</p>

<p>
The example command line below generates a file JclQGraphics.pas in subdirectory
CLX from file Graphics.cb located in the current directory.  Symbols "VisualCLX"
and "COMPILER6_UP" are specified as defined, "Bitmap32" and "VCL" as undefined.
</p>

<pre>
  jpp -c -dVisualCLX -dCOMPILER6_UP -uBitmap32 -uVCL -xCLX\JclQ Graphics.cb
</pre>

<h3>Generating Jcl[Q]Graphics.pas and Jcl[Q]GraphUtils.pas</h3>
<p>
First compile Preprocessor\jpp.exe from Preprocessor\jpp.dpr.
Then change to the "Source" directory and type "make" at the command line.
This will create the units <br>

VCL\JclGraphics.pas <br>
VCL\JclGraphUtils.pas <br>
CLX\JclQGraphics.pas <br>
CLX\JclQGraphUtils.pas <br>
</p>
<p>
from their prototypes _Graphics.pas and _GraphUtils.pas.
</p>


<h3>Minimizing VCL dependencies</h3>
<p>
To reduce VCL dependencies in JCL, the following changes have been made:
</p>

<menu>
<dl>
	<dt>JclFileUtils<dd>PathCompactPath is an overloaded function.  The variant which takes a TCanvas
    as argument (and thus creates a dependency on VCL unit Graphics) has been
    removed.
</dl>

<br>

<dl>
	<dt>JclShell<dd> ShellLinkGetIcon has been removed.  It could get part of some genuine
    VCL-dependent unit (e.g. JclGraphUtils), but for now it is left out.
</dl>

<br>

<dl>
	<dt>JclPEImage<dd><pre> Replace "uses Consts," by

    uses
      {$IFDEF COMPILER6_UP}
      RtlConsts,         // VisualCLX-package compatible (part of rtlxx.bpl)
      {$ELSE}
      Consts,            // not VisualCLX-package compatible (part of vclxx.bpl)
      {$ENDIF COMPILER6_UP} </pre>
</dl>
</menu>

<p>
Note that the first two changes have enormous impact, since many JCL units use 
JclFileUtils and JclSysInfo (which both use JclShell).  This leaves JclGraphics 
and JclGraphUtils as sole units with genuine VCL/VisualCLX-dependencies.
JclPrint is the only remaining pure VCL-dependent units. </p>

<h3>New directory structure</h3>
<p>
With the new JCL release we introduce a more appropriate source file directory
structure. The files are now grouped according their respective layers.
</p>

<pre>
Source/
  Common
  DotNet
  Unix
  VCL
  VisCLX
  Windows   
</pre>

<h3>Status - Platforms</h3>
<p>
This table gives a short overview of which units are already working under three 
different Delphi language compilers/platforms. There are three status 
levels possible:
</p>

<p>
<li>Yes - The unit has been ported to that platform </li>
<li>No - The unit has not been ported to that platform</li>
<li>dependant - The unit is platform dependant and will not be ported.</li>

<h3>Assembler</h3>
<p>
For crossplatform compatability it is absolutely necessary to reduce the amount
of inline assembler code used. Therefore as a general rule every line of assembler
<b>must have a pure pascal pendant</b>. Please use assembler only if it really 
has a noticeable impact on the libraries performance. 

<pre>
{$IFNDEF PUREPASCAL}
  // assembler code here
{$ELSE}
  // Delphi equivalent here
{$ENDIF}
