Summary: JCL 1.103 Preview available<br>

Date: 2008-09-09 21:40<br><br>
The JCL team is proud to give a preview of the library that supports CodeGear's new products Delphi 2009 and C++Builder 2009 with native Unicode support (codename was Tiburon).<br><br>

This preview should not be considered as stable software, it introduces breaking changes to previously released JCL 1.102.

Users who absolutely need a stable version of the library should stay with JCL 1.102.

Users who need a version of the JCL for Delphi 2009 and C++Builder 2009 may use this preview because JCL 1.102 is not compatible with these new products.<br>

Feedback about this preview concerning backward compatibility and Unicode support will highly be appreciated.<br><br>

Users of subversion, may use this external link to import the JCL into their repository: https://jcl.svn.sourceforge.net:443/svnroot/jcl/tags/JCL-1.103-Build3110-Preview<br><br>

This preview supports the following versions of Delphi and C++Builder:<br>

* RAD Studio 2007 (Delphi 2007, C++Builder 2007); <br>
* BDS 2006 (Delphi 2006, C++Builder 2006 and Delphi.net 2006); <br>
* Delphi.net 2005; <br>
* Delphi.net 8 (experts only); <br>
* C#Builder 1 (experts only); <br>
* Delphi 7 <br>
* Delphi 6 and C++Builder 6; <br>
* Delphi 5 and C++Builder 5. <br><br>

Note that the support of Delphi.net 2007 and Delphi 2005 is broken.<br><br>

Head changes for this releease are:<br>

* security update to BZip2 1.0.5; <br>
* native Unicode support; <br>
* update to Unicode Character Database 5.1.0; <br>
* introduction of string streams with automatic conversions; <br>
* Streams compatible with Delphi.net; <br>
* container rework (thread safe implementation, new contained types: WideString, Single, Double, Extended..., compatibility with iterators, split to a dedicated package); <br>
* Installation to multiple local user accounts at the same time; <br>
* updated detection of CPU features; <br>
* new functions in JclStrings to expand tab to spaces; <br>
* added properties to TJclSimpleXml to enumerate elements by name; <br>
* added archive support (.zip, .rar, .tar, .gz, .bzip, .iso...) based on sevenzip code; <br>
* support for callout in PCRE; <br>
* added project-wide settings for the debug expert. <br>
