JCL is build by the community, but more importantly, for the community. Therefore
we would like to hear from you. If you have any comments or suggestions we would
appreciate it if you would drop us a note. There are several ways to get in contact
with us.
<UL>
  <LI>You can always <A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">contact us</A> directly
      by e-mail.
  <LI>If you want to keep up to date about JCL then you can join the JCL mailing list
      either by going to <A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/group/JEDI-JCL">JCL egroups page</A> or by
      sending <A HREF="mailto:JEDI-JCL-subscribe@egroups.com ">an email to egroups</A>.
      You can also use this list to voice your opinion, comments or suggestions.

<H3>Bug reports</H3>
We have worked hard to eliminate as many bugs as possible and I like to think that we
succeeded in finding them all. That, however, if is not realistic thinking. It is
very likely that bugs are still present in the JCL. If you (think) you found one
we would really like to know about it. You have several options for this, you can
<A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">e-mail me</A> or the Project JEDI testing
coordinator, <A HREF="mailto:jcl-testing@delphi-jedi.org">Matthias Thomas</A>, directly.
Alternatively you can also send a bugreport to the aforementioned mailing list.
<B>Never contact the author of the code directly</B>.
In any event, when you submit a bugreport please observe that the report should
be detailed enough for us to (attempt to) reproduce it. Therefore it should
contain at least the following information:
