<H1>Submitting Code</H1>
<P>
The JEDI Code Library is built upon donations made by the community. In the past
several people have already donated their code snippets allowing us to build the
library that you see before you today. This, however, is not the end of the JCL.
As long as new donations arrive we will continue to develop and expand the JCL.
Therefore the continuation of the JCL really lies in your hands. If you have some
code snippets that you think would be suitable for inclusion in the JCL then we
would love to receive them.

<H3>The rules</H3>
There are a few rules that need to be observed. These primarily exist to protect
ourselves and to make the inclusion of your code as efficient and smooth as possible:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>All code that is submitted will be released under the terms of the Mozilla
      Public License after being processed by the JCL team. By submitting code to
      Project JEDI you implicitly agree to - and are assumed to understand the
      implications of this. The <A HREF="MPL\MPL 1.0.htm">MPL 1.0 specification</A>
      as well as a <A HREF="MPL\MPL FAQ.htm">FAQ</A> has been
      included elsewhere in this document. I suggest you at least glance through
      it before submitting your code. If you still have questions you can always
      contact us or post a question to the <A HREF="Feedback.htm">JEDI-JCL mailing
      list</A>.
  <LI>Submissions must be your own. If code is not your own, you are responsible
      for making sure that the code is not subject to any copyright or license
      that would prevent the JCL team to modify the code and release the
      resulting code under the terms of the MPL license.
  <LI>Code must be packaged in a standard WinZip compatible file. You should use
      the highest compression available. Inside the package you must include an
      ascii text-only readme.txt file which clearly states your name, your e-mail
      address, optionally your homepage address and whether you want to remain
      anonymous or not.
  <LI>Submitted code is subject to being reformatted to match the style conventions
      used throughout the JCL. In addition the code may be modified. Generically
      speaking you will not be contacted for permission to carry out modifications.
      No matter how much your code is modified, at all times the documentation
      will reflect you as being the author of the code. If you have objections
      to this you can include a note about it in the readme.txt. In that case
      we will not modify your code or contact you for permission. This only
      applies to significant modifications.
  <LI>The JCL is <U>not</U> a visual component library. To avoid confusion, a
      class is considered a component when it derives from TComponent and it's
      usage requires it to be installed in the IDE and be 'dropped on a form'.
      These kind of a classes will not be included in the JCL. If you have a
      component that you like to share with the world through Project JEDI then
      please go to <A HREF="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/Jedi:VCLVCL:888634123">Project JEDI VCL</A>
      for the details on how to do that. A class that does not need to be installed
      in the IDE, eventhough it may exhibit some kind of visual interface at
      runtime, is not considered a component and is perfectly acceptable for the
      JCL.
</UL>
<P>
With that said, you can send your donations, by e-mail,
to <A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">the JCL team</A>. Please use "JEDI Code
Library Donation" as the subject line and attach the zip-file as described in the previous
section to the e-mail. Note that due to the volume of code that has been donated
already we may not be able to include your code immediately into the next release.
Depending on the volume of new donations we also may not get back to you in a
timely manner, or at all. Usually we will reply with a "thank you" but in case you
don't receive such a message you should check the <A HREF="Contributors.htm">contributors page</A>
of the next JCL release. If your name does not appear there something may have gone
wrong and you should <A HREF="Feedback.htm">contact us</A>.
