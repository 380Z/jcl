<H1>Getting involved</H1>
Creating a library such as the JCL is a lot of work. If you have some spare time
and would like to get involved in the development of the JCL then please
<A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">contact us</A>. There are several ways in which
you can contribute:
<UL>
  <LI>Donating code. See <A HREF="Submitting Code.htm">Submitting Code</A>
  <LI>Making suggestions for improvements and submitting bugreports. See
      <A HREF="Feedback.htm">Feedback</A> on how to contact us.
  <LI>Testing the JCL. In this case you should contact the Project JEDI
      <A HREF="mailto:jcl-testing@delphi-jedi.org">testing coordinator</A> (currently this is Matthias Thomas).
  <LI>Development of new code. This is similar to donating code except that it
      will be carried out with a few more restrictions and in a slightly more
      coordinated manner. You can submit ideas for new code or be assigned to
      develop code based on request received from the community.
  <LI>Unit owner. In this case you will be assigned to one or more units in the
      JCL which from that point on will be maintained by you. This means that you
      will be responsible for all modifications made to that unit. For example,
      bugreports and new donations will be forwarded to you for processing.
  <LI>Processing donations. This will mean that submitted code will be forwarded
      to you. You factor out routines that can be included in the JCL, reformat
      them and do some initial testing. After that you forward the code to the
      unit owner in which the new code is to be included.
  <LI>This is not an extensive list. If you have other ideas or suggestions:
      <A HREF="mailto:jcl@delphi-jedi.org">contact us</A>.
