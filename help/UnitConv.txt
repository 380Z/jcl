[Declaration]
function MakePercentage(const Step, Max: Longint): Longint;
[ShortDescr]
Hehe, no way...
[Description]
I dare not describe this function's purpose. See the Notes section below. As a
tribute to that wonderful article this function has been designated the alias
HowAOneLinerCanBiteYou. You are encouraged to use that alias in your applications
as opposed to the much more readable and self-explanatory name MakePercentage :-)
[Parameters]
Count=2
1=Step:Longint=Sorry, no can do.
2=Max:Longint=No idea, but I do know that passing 0 will trigger an assertion if
you have assertions enabled or a runtime error (EDivByZero) if not.
[Result]
All I have to say about this is that it is very well possible that the result
may be larger than 100 and that the sign of the arguments is preserved so it is
possible that the result is negative.
[Notes]
Count=1
1=For a very educational dissection of this function have a look at the
article written by Robert Marquardt entitled "<A HREF="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/Jedi:VOYBUGHUNT">
Lessons in good programming or how a one liner can bite you</A>" available at the Voyager section on the JEDI website.
