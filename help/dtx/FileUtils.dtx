Summary:
  Implements a file mapping view object.
Description:
  TJclFileMappingView implements the view for a filemapping object. Do not construct
  objects of this class directly, instead use the TJclCustomFileMapping.Add method.
  A TJclFileMappingView object can be used to read from and write to a specific
  area in a filemapping. You can create multiple views including ones that overlap.
  The Operating System guarantees that multiple views remain coherent as long as
  they are created from the same filemapping object. Standard Win32 view
  objects provide an abstraction to manipulate a file as if it were a block of
  memory using pointers. TJclFileMappingView takes this a bit further by allowing
  you to use the familiar TStream interface to manipulate the view. If you so desire
  you can still use the 'memory' directly by using the Memory property.

<GROUP FilesandIO.Streams.TJclCustomFileMapping>
Summary:
  Wrapper for Win32 filemapping object.
Description:
  TJclCustomFileMapping is a wrapper for a Win32 filemapping object. In a nutshell,
  a filemapping is an abstraction of a disk file which allows you to manipulate the
  file as if it were just another block of memory, as such you manipulate it using
  pointers. The filemapping object itself is only used to maintain the association
  with the file, while a filemapping view object is used to manipulate (part of) the
  file. You can create multiple views of a (part of a) file which are guaranteed to
  remain coherent. Additionally you can create a filemapping object which is
  associated with the swap file as opposed to an actual disk file. Since multiple
  processes can open a handle to the same filemapping, this is an ideal way to
  share data between multiple processes. <P>
  Unless you are opening a filemapping object as opposed to creating one, you should
  not use this class directly. Instead use the derived TJclFileMapping and
  TJclSwapFileMapping classes. These two classes only differ in their constructors
  but do prevent you from a common mistake (related to the return value of CreateFile).

@@TJclTempFileStream.Create
Summary:
  Creates an instance of TJclTempFileStream.
Description:
  Create creates a temporary file in the temporary folder as returned by
  GetTempPath. The file is created with read and write access and is deleted as
  soon as it is closed. The file cannot be opened by another call to CreateFile.
  The file is created with the temporary attribute which means the system will
  attempt to keep the file's data in memory rather than caching it. Therefore you
  should free the object as soon as possible using the Free destructor. The file
  is automatically deleted when the object is destroyed.
Parameters:
  Prefix - On input the first three characters of the string are used to form the name of the temporary file (can be empty). On return, assuming the function succeeded, the FileName property contains the actual name of the temporary file, including the path.

Description:
  FindUnusedFileName returns a unique filename composed of the FileName and Suffix
  parts and an optional number. If a file of the form FileName + Suffix.FileExt
  doesn't exist yet this is the name that's returned. If such a file already exists
  the function appends a number to the filename, starting at '1' and continues to
  increment this number until no file with the composed filename exists. For example,
  calling FindUnusedFileName('My', 'txt', 'File') while a file named 'MyFile.txt'
  and 'MyFile1.txt' already exists, will return 'MyFile2.txt' (the sequence tried
  by the function is 'MyFile.txt', 'MyFile1.txt' and 'MyFile2.txt').
Parameters:

Parameters:
  DC - Device context used for retrieving font metrics. This should be the canvas on which you eventually intend to display the compacted path.
  Path - The path to compact or truncate.
  Width - Width, in pixels, that the path will be forced to fit within.
  CmpFmt - Determines which part of the string is replaced with an ellipsis. Valid values are:   <TABLE>

Summary:
  Locks the specified volume.
Description:
  LockVolume locks the specified volume. Locking a volume will give exclusive access
  to the specified volume to whoever owns the lock. Subsequent access to the
  volume must be performed through the returned handle. When you're done with the
  volume you must call UnLockVolume. Note that to lock a volume there
  can be no open files on the volume (even a single open file, by whatever process,
  will cause the function to fail).
Parameters:
  Volume - The volume to lock this must be a string in the format:    * X: Where X is the volume to lock, for example 'a:'  * PHYSICALDRIVEX Where X is the 0 based hard disk number, for example 'PHYSICALDRIVE0'    <B>Note:</B> Do not prepend the Volume name with a '\\.\'. This is done by the function.
  Handle - Receives a handle of the locked device upon successful return.
Result:
  If the function succeeds in locking the volume it returns True and a handle to
  the specified device in the Handle parameter. If it fails the function returns
  False and the Handle parameter is undefined.
Notes:
  You must have administrative privileges to lock a volume.
  The device is, according to Microsoft recommendations, opened with no buffering. This action imposes a number of 'limitations' for subsequent access to the device. For example the alignment of buffers must be on a multiple of the volume's sector size. See the Platform SDK for details.

Description:
  BuildFileList builds a list of files and folders in the specified Path that

  FindFirst, FindNext and FindClose functions.
Parameters:
  Path - Directory and filename mask for which you want to build the list. For example this can be 'c:\winnt\*.dll'. This parameter works like the Path parameter in FindFirst. In Windows it is case insensitive and applies to short and long filenames, so "*.*" will find all files. In Linux it's case sensitive and "*.*" will find only files that contain a ".".
  Attr - The Attr parameter specifies the special files to include in addition to all normal files. Choose from these file attribute constants when specifying the Attr parameter (declared in SysUtils.pas):    * faReadOnly Read-only files  * faHidden Hidden files  * faSysFile System files  * faVolumeID Volume ID files  * faDirectory Directory files  * faArchive Archive files  * faAnyFile Any file  
  List - A TStrings descendant in which the file list that matched the Path and Attr parameters is returned. Note that this list is not cleared by the routine before the found entries are added.
Result:

Description:
  AdvBuildFileList builds a list of files and folders in the specified Path that

Parameters:
  Path - Directory and file name mask for which you want to build the list. For example this can be 'c:\winnt\*.dll'. This parameter works like the Path parameter in FindFirst. In Windows it is case insensitive and applies to short and long filenames, so "*.*" will find all files. In Linux it's case sensitive and "*.*" will find only files that contain a ".".
  Attr - The Attr parameter specifies the special files to include in addition to all normal files. Choose from these file attribute constants when specifying the Attr parameter (declared in SysUtils.pas):    * faReadOnly Read-only files  * faHidden Hidden files  * faSysFile System files  * faVolumeID Volume ID files  * faDirectory Directory files  * faArchive Archive files  * faAnyFile Any file  
  List - A TStrings descendant in which the file list according to the parameters is returned. Note that this list is not cleared by the routine before the found entries are added.
  Options - Set of additional option:    * flFullNames: if set, the full path is included with each listed file name.  *  flRecursive: if set, all subdirectories of the directory given in PATH are scanned.  * flMaskedSubfolders: if set, files are only listed if their directory path, relative to the directory given in the Path parameter, matches the Subfolder Mask parameter.  
  SubfoldersMask - if flMaskedSubfolders is set, the remaining directory path, relative to the directory given in the Path parameter, is matched against this parameter. In Windows the matching is done case insensitively, in Linux it's done case sensitively. In Windows (with long file names enabled) only the long name is matched, so "*.*" will find only directories that contain a ".".
Result:
  If the function succeeds it returns True, otherwise it returns False. In case of
  failure the list contains the entries that were retrieved up to the point of
  failure.

@@TDelTreeProgress
<GROUP FilesandIO.FilesandDirectories>
Summary:
  Progress callback routine for the DelTreeEx function.
Description:
  TDelTreeProgress is the function signature for the Progress parameter of the
  DelTreeEx function. This function is called just before the file is deleted. You
  can use this callback routine to display progress to the user. To allow DelTreeEx
  to continue deleting files return True, to abort the deletion return False.
Parameters:
  FileName - The name of the file that is about to be deleted.
  Attr - The attributes of the file. See GetFileAttributes in the Platform SDK for a full list of attribute flags.
Result:
  If you return True DelTreeEx deletes the specified file and continues with the
  next one. If you return False DeltreeEx aborts immediately.
Notes:
  Returning False will abort the entire deletion process, not just for the specified file only.

@@DelTree
<GROUP FilesandIO.FilesandDirectories>
Summary:
  Recursively deletes a folder.
Description:
  DelTree recursively deletes a folder much like the DOS command. That is, it deletes
  a folder and everything in it. If parts of the folder tree cannot be deleted, eg
  because some files may be currently open, the function attempts to delete as
  much as possible before returning.
Parameters:
  Path - The folder to delete. Must be fully qualified. May have a trailing backslash but that's optional.
Result:
  If the function succeeds in deleting the folder the result is True, if the function
  fails the result is False. In case of failure the function attempts to delete
  as much as possible before returning. Thus on failure part of the folder may have
  been deleted while some files and folders may still exist. Failure is usually due
  to insufficient access rights or because some files are currently open (locked).
Notes:
  The deletions are permanent! Deletions are not recoverable through the recycle bin.

<GROUP FilesandIO.FilesandDirectories>
Summary:
  Recursively deletes a folder.
Description:
  DelTree recursively deletes a folder much like the DOS command. That is, it deletes
  a folder and everything in it. If parts of the folder tree cannot be deleted, eg
  because some files may be currently open, the function attempts to delete as
  much as possible before returning or immediately returns, depending on the
  AbortOnFailure parameter. The function is capable of providing the caller with
  progress information through the Progress function parameter.
Parameters:
  Path - The folder to delete. Must be fully qualified. May have a trailing backslash but that's optional.
  AbortOnFailure - If True the function immediately returns when it encounters a file or directory it cannot delete. If False the function continues attempting to delete the remaining Files. In either case, if one or more files couldn't be deleted the function result is False.
  Progress - Function that is called just before a file is deleted. This allows you to display progress to the user and even abort the deletion. This parameter is optional (you can specify nil). See TDelTreeProgress For more information.
Result:
  If the function succeeds in deleting the folder the result is True, if the function
  fails the result is False. In case of failure the function attempts to delete
  as much as possible before returning or continues deleting depending on the
  AbortOnFailure parameter. Thus on failure part of the folder may have been deleted
  while some files and folders may still exist. Failure is usually due to insufficient

@@DirectoryExists
<GROUP FilesandIO.FilesandDirectories>
Summary:

Description:
  DirectoryExists determines whether the specified directory exists.
Parameters:
  Name - The directory to check for existence. If Name is not fully qualified it is interpreted as relative to the current directory.
Result:
  If the directory exists the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
Notes:
  This function is a replacement for the FileUtils.DirectoryExists function from the Delphi RTL to avoid dependency on that particular unit. There's nothing wrong with that function except that the unit uses Forms etc. which add significant resources and startup time to your application (if it doesn't use these units already).

  The Create constructor creates an instance of the TJclFileVersionInfo class and
  attaches it to the executable specified by FileName. If successful you can use
  the properties of TJclFileVersionInfo to start reading the version resource information
  from the executable. If the constructor cannot read the version resource from
  the specified file (e.g. because the file does not exist or does not have a version
  resource) an exception is raised (using RaiseLastWin32Error). To avoid the
  exception and check beforehand if the file has a version resource you can use
  the VersionResourceAvailable
  function.
Parameters:
  AFileName - The fully qualified name of the file whose version resource to read.
Notes:
  To include version information in your own projects select "Project | Options" and go to the "Version Info" tab.
