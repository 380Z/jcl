JclDebug
--------
* (Florent) TJclLocationInfoEx should replace TJclLocationInfo

* extending TJclThreadInfoList.Gather to exclude a set of threads or to include a set of threads
  (multiple functions to make things more clear)

* ? merge TJclDebugThreadInfo/TJclDebugThreadList and TJclThreadInfo/TJclThreadInfoList
  - investigate if the stack can stay a TJclStackInfoList and if the location information can be retrieved later correctly


Expert
------
* storing the layout 
  - e.g. settings of the stack listviews
  - should go into the desktop layout and not into the expert settings?

* serialization 
  - saving/loading
  - which classes for the viewer?
    (for exam. JclDebug.TJclModuleInfoList vs. JclDebugStackUtils.TModuleList;
     TJclModuleInfoList doesn't store the module name, because
     this can be get from the handle which doesn't work in the viewer)

* Revision property
  - Integration UNITVERSIONING into TJclLocationInfoEx, but also adding an option to use the version info of a module binary as revision

* progress for TfrmStackView.PrepareStack 
  (getting revisions for a real SCM system can take some time)

* icon's

* clean up
  - use updated TJclFileEnumerator instead of TFileSearcher
  - remove IJclLineNumberTranslator stuff in StackLineNumberTranslator.pas
  - rename some files
  - MPL headers
  - UNITVERSIONING
