JclDebug
--------
* (Florent) TJclLocationInfoEx should replace TJclLocationInfo

* extending TJclThreadInfoList.Gather to exclude a set of threads or to include a set of threads
  (multiple functions to make things more clear)
  - one function for exclude
  - one function for include
    (exclude + include together doesn't make sense without any wildcard like stuff)

* ? merge TJclDebugThreadInfo/TJclDebugThreadList and TJclThreadInfo/TJclThreadInfoList
  - investigate if the stack can stay a TJclStackInfoList and if the location information can be retrieved later correctly


Expert
------
* serialization 
  - saving/loading
  - which classes for the viewer?
    (for exam. JclDebug.TJclModuleInfoList vs. JclDebugStackUtils.TModuleList;
     TJclModuleInfoList doesn't store the module name, because
     this can be get from the handle which doesn't work in the viewer)

* Revision property
  - load revision info provide in stack trace

* progress for TfrmStackView.PrepareStack 
  (getting revisions from a real SCM system can take some time)

* icon's

* clean up/minor things
  - add and test desktop state stuff in DLL expert mode
  - use updated TJclFileEnumerator instead of TFileSearcher
  - rename some files
  - add MPL headers
  - add UNITVERSIONING

* integrate it into the installation
  - generate packages, JclPackages*.* and resources.mak for 5 - 10
