JEDI INSTALLER
==============

Helps you to integrate JCL with Delphi IDE (BCB is not yet supported and
requires manual installation). Currently it assists with:

- Compiling library units (release and debug versions)
- Compiling packages and installing design-time packages to the IDE
- Adding sample JCL Debug extension dialogs to Object Repository
- Adding JCL directories to Library Path / Browsing Path in Environment Options
- Adding JCL debug .dcu directory to Debug DCU Path in Debugger Options
- Integrating JCL help file to the IDE.

To execute for

1) Delphi/Win32
- click on "Install.bat" file in the JCL root directory.

  Note:	If you have Delphi 8 for Microsoft .NET installed, you probably will have 
	to specify the make.exe to use for JCL installation; on the commandline, 
	type (for example):

	>install "C:\Program Files\Borland\Delphi5\Bin\make.exe"

2) Kylix 3 for Delphi
- open a shell window
- cd into JCL root directory
- at the command prompt, type "sh ./install.sh", then press "Enter"

NOTE:
======
We know of one case where there was a problem when running install.bat:

Undeclared identifier: "TObjectList"
Unable to compile file: snmp.pas

The solution was to move the D7/D7.Net paths to the end of Environement Vars.

To do so, on NT/XP right-click My Computer,Properties,Advanced, Environment
Variables, Find the PATH variable in the System variables list, click the Edit
button and change the value (move D7 paths to the end).
